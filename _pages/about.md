# About Me
---

I'm Muxi Lyu, a security research assistant at Johns Hopkins University, where I completed my **M.S.E. in Computer Science** (Fall 2024) and my **B.S. in Computer Science** with a second major in **Applied Mathematics and Statistics** (Spring 2024). Throughout my time at Hopkins, I’ve been deeply grateful to be advised by **Prof. Yinzhi Cao**, whose mentorship has shaped and sparked my passion for security research.

In Fall 2025, I’ll begin my **Ph.D. in Computer Science** at **UC Berkeley**.

My research lies at the intersection of **web and software security**, **program analysis**, and **AI for security**. I’m particularly interested in hybrid approaches that combine the precision of static and dynamic analysis with the predictive power of large language models (LLMs). My goal is to develop AI-empowered security techniques that detect vulnerabilities before an attack occurs and strengthen defenses against exploitation — ensuring stronger protection of users’ data, privacy, and digital trust.

Beyond academic research, I was fortunate to join Team *42-b3yond-6ug* in the **DARPA AIxCC competition**, where we advanced to the final round (Top 7) and were awarded $2 million in August 2025.<br><br>

### Follow My Flow: Unveiling Client-Side Prototype Pollution Gadgets from One Million Real-World Websites [[paper]](https://yinzhicao.org/ProbetheProto/FollowMyFlow.pdf)
Zifeng Kang, ***Muxi Lyu***, Zhengyu Liu, Jianjia Yu, Runqi Fan, Song Li, Yinzhi Cao  
*To appear at IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (S&P Oakland), 2025*

- Our evaluation revealed **133 zero-day gadgets** not found by prior work. Notably, one was found in **Meta's software** (acknowledged with a bug bounty), and another in the **Vue framework**, resulting in **CVE-2024-6783**. Additionally, GALA identified **23 websites** where prototype pollution vulnerabilities — previously deemed inconsequential — led to real consequences through the discovered gadgets.

# Miscellaneous
---

- My name is **Muxi (沐曦)**, pronounced *moo-shee*, which means *standing under the first beam of sunshine in the morning*.  
- While I'm mostly introverted, I love collaborating and building with others. I served as **Co-Director of [HopHacks](https://hophacks.com)**, leading JHU’s 36-hour hackathon for 300+ participants, and as **Vice President of [CSSA](https://www.jhucssa.com)**, where I managed the tech team and helped organize orientation events for over 1,000 new students.  
- I enjoy working on interesting projects that improve daily life. I co-founded [**GooseCart**](https://goosecart.com/), a venture developed through the [*PavaCenter Summer Incubator Program*](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/goosecart_goosecart-startup-prototyping-activity-7193428258158247936-5dxt?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADg2Rp4BflnAnkjD2UdkogFul721Ewg6G2I) at JHU. Other projects include a Campus Hiring System (with JHU COLLAB), a Campus Marketplace (with JHU CSSA), and an Alumni Hub (with JHU CSSA).  
- I love cooking and baking — often as a midnight stress reliever. One of my long-time New Year’s resolutions has been to start a culinary channel... let’s see when I finally do it!
